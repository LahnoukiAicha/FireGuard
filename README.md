# FIREGUARD Web App

Welcome to the FIREGUARD Web App README! This application is designed to help you track wildfires in near real-time using an interactive map and predict forest wildfires using Python. Below, you'll find information on how to get started and use the app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the FIREGUARD Web App, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (for the React.js frontend)
- Python 3 (for the Flask backend and predictive analytics)

### Installation

1. Clone the FIREGUARD repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fireguard-web-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd fireguard

3. Install the React.js frontend dependencies:

npm install

The backend should now be running and serving the React.js frontend.

3. Access the FIREGUARD Web App through your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

## Configuration

You can configure various aspects of the FIREGUARD Web App by modifying the configuration files provided in the `config` directory. Make sure to update the API keys, database connections, and other settings as needed.

## Predictive Analytics

The predictive analytics for wildfire forecasting are implemented in Python. You can find the relevant code in this repo :https://github.com/LahnoukiAicha/ForestPrediction.git  . To improve the accuracy of wildfire predictions, you may need to fine-tune the algorithms and incorporate new data sources.
