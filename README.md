# FIREGUARD Web App

Welcome to the FIREGUARD Web App README! This application is designed to help you track wildfires in near real-time using an interactive map and predict forest wildfires using Python. Below, you'll find information on how to get started and use the app.

## Getting Started
Our project empowers communities to actively monitor and report fires using technology and publicly available data. We enhance data accessibility for various stakeholders and focus on using data insights, particularly in understanding aerosol chemistry in different fire types, to predict and prevent wildfires effectively. This collaborative approach aims to protect lives, property, and natural resources from escalating fire threats.


###Background:

The escalating frequency and severity of wildfires present a pressing challenge for communities and natural resource management. To address this issue, our project focuses on leveraging technology and publicly available data, such as NASA's satellite-derived active fire data, to empower local communities and improve fire management.
As wildfires continue to increase in frequency, number, and size, it has become imperative to expand the utilization of such data beyond traditional users. We aim to bridge this gap by creating innovative solutions that enable diverse stakeholder groups, including local residents, emergency responders, and policymakers, to access, understand, and utilize critical fire-related information effectively.
Early Detection and Prevention:
 Wildfires and agricultural burns incur substantial economic costs. Our project seeks to mitigate these costs by better predicting fire occurrences and detecting early warning signs. Leveraging historical and informative data from NASA, we aim to develop predictive models that can lead to early intervention and more effective fire management.op user-friendly tools and resources that enable local communities to actively participate in fire monitoring, reporting, and response efforts. This approach fosters a sense of ownership and ensures rapid reactions to fire threats.
Data Accessibility:
 Enhance the distribution of vital fire and natural resource data, making it readily accessible to a wider range of stakeholders. This includes creating user-friendly interface and data-sharing platform.
Data collection:
In the initial phase of our project, we focus on collecting vital data from NASA's space website, which serves as a rich source of information on active fires and related environmental factors. NASA's satellite-derived active fire data provide invaluable insights into the location, intensity, and dynamics of fires on a global scale. This data includes critical details such as fire hotspots, burn scars, and aerosol emissions, which are essential for understanding the behavior of wildfires and agricultural burns. By tapping into NASA's extensive satellite monitoring capabilities, we gain access to real-time and historical data, enabling us to track fire trends, assess their impact, and develop predictive models. This data collection forms the cornerstone of our project, empowering us to make informed decisions and create innovative solutions for effective fire management and community engagement.

### Prerequisites

Before running the FIREGUARD Web App, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (for the React.js frontend)
- Python 3 (for the Flask backend and predictive analytics)

### Installation

1. Clone the FIREGUARD repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fireguard-web-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd fireguard

3. Install the React.js frontend dependencies:

npm install

The backend should now be running and serving the React.js frontend.

3. Access the FIREGUARD Web App through your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).
